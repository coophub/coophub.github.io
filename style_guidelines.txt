Overall Look and Feel of Coophub
===============================

The website will feature a main page and only a main page which will contain everything the user would need to know
about. This approach allows for maximum engagement as users would only have to scroll and would not have to wait for the
page to refresh.

Colours
========
Coophub should look professional and feel like a workplace. We will be using black and white for the professional look with an accent of yellow.
