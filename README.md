### Centralized platform for employers and students to connect and match.
We help by being a middle man between a company and the university, by being a universal hub
for employers to post jobs to schools individualized coop navigators using a single portal.
This streamlines the hiring process by letting employers choose multiple schools at once
and so they do not have to learn the mulitple complicated portals while having no loss in
exposure for the job offering, allowing the employer to employ the best employees and spend
less time doing so.
